# Design System Integration Log

## 2025-05-24
- Initialized design system implementation for SaaS platform.
- **Base Layer:** Tailwind CSS v4 (already present).
- **Component Layer:** Attempted to install Untitled UI React components, but package not found on npm. Will use existing UI components and supplement with open-source patterns.
- **Iconography:** Installed `lucide-react` for modern, open-source icons.
- Updated documentation page to showcase reusable UI elements, patterns, and design tokens.
- Next: Integrate more open-source UI patterns and document usage for the team.

## 2025-05-24 (continued)
- Added Alert, Dialog, and Navbar patterns to the Documentation page for live preview and reference.
- Ensured all patterns use Tailwind CSS v4 and are compatible with Untitled UI design principles.
- Documentation page now serves as a live design library for the team.
